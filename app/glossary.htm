				<p><strong>Active Shooter:</strong> An  individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a  confined space or other populated area, most often using firearms and following  no pattern or method in the selection of victims. (DHS Active Shooter)</p>
				<p><strong>After-Action Report (AAR):</strong> Report that summarizes key exercise-related evaluation information, including the exercise overview and analysis of objectives and core capabilities. (HSEEP 2013)</p>
				<p><strong>All-Hazards: </strong>A grouping classification encompassing all conditions,  environmental or human-caused,  that have the potential to cause injury, illness, or death; damage to or loss  of equipment, infrastructure services, or property; or alternatively causing  functional degradation to social, economic, or environmental aspects. (NIPP)</p>
				<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> The effect of an event, incident, or occurrence. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>Drill:</strong> a coordinated, supervised activity usually employed to validate a specific operation or function in a single agency or organization. Drills are commonly used to provide training on new equipment, develop or validate new policies or procedures, or practice and maintain current skills. (HSEEP 2013)</p>
				<p><strong>Emergency Operations Plan (EOP):</strong> An ongoing plan for responding to a wide variety of potential threats and hazards. (NIMS) </p>
				<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> An instrument to train for, assess, practice, and improve performance in prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery capabilities in a risk-free environment. Exercises can be used for testing and validating policies, plans, procedures, training, equipment, and interagency agreements; clarifying and training personnel in roles and responsibilities; improving interagency coordination and communications; improving individual performance; identifying gaps in resources; and identifying opportunities for improvement. (HSEEP 2013)</p>
				<p><strong>Hazard: </strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Something that is potentially dangerous or harmful, often the root cause of an unwanted outcome. (NIPP, NIMS)</li>
					<li>Natural or man-made source or cause of harm or difficulty (DHS Risk Lexicon)</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Imminent Threat:</strong> Intelligence or operational information that warns of a credible, specific, and impending terrorist threat or ongoing attack against the United States and its territories that is sufficiently specific and credible to recommend implementation of protective measures to thwart or mitigate against an attack. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>Incident:</strong> An occurrence, caused by either human action or natural phenomena, that may cause harm and may require action. Incidents can include major disasters, emergencies, terrorist attacks, terrorist threats, wild and urban fires, floods, hazardous materials spills, nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, war-related disasters, public health and medical emergencies, and other occurrences requiring an emergency response. (NIPP, DHS Risk Lexicon)</p>
				<p><strong>Incident Command System (ICS):</strong> A standardized on-scene emergency management construct specifically designed to provide an integrated organizational structure that reflects the complexity and demands of single or multiple incidents, without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. ICS is the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents. It is used for all kinds of emergencies and is applicable to small as well as large and complex incidents. ICS is used by various jurisdictions and functional agencies, both public and private, to organize field-level incident management operations. (NIMS)</p>
				<p><strong>Incident Management:</strong> The broad spectrum of activities and organizations providing effective and efficient operations, coordination, and support applied at all levels of government, utilizing both governmental and nongovernmental resources to plan for, respond to, and recover from an incident, regardless of cause, size, or complexity. (NIMS)</p>
				<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> The capabilities necessary to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>National Incident Management System:</strong> A set of principles that provides a systematic, proactive approach guiding government agencies at all levels, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to work seamlessly to prevent, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity, in order to reduce the loss of life or property and harm to the environment. (NIMS)</p>
				<p><strong>National Preparedness:</strong> The actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build and sustain the capabilities necessary to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond 	to, and recover from those threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> The capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened or actual act of terrorism. For the purposes of the prevention framework called for in PPD-8, the term &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; refers to preventing imminent threats. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>Protection:</strong> The capabilities necessary to secure the homeland against acts of terrorism and manmade or natural disasters. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>Psychological Consequence:</strong> Effect of an incident, event, or occurrence on the mental or emotional state of individuals or groups resulting in a change in perception and/or behavior (DHS Risk Lexicon)</p>
				<p><strong>Public Information:</strong> Processes, procedures, and systems for communicating timely,	accurate, and accessible information on an incident&rsquo;s cause, size, and current situation;	resources committed; and other matters of general interest to the public, responders, and	additional stakeholders (both directly affected and indirectly affected). (NIMS)</p>
				<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> The capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident to recover effectively. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Personnel and major items of equipment, supplies, and facilities available or potentially available for assignment to incident operations and for which status is maintained. Resources are described by kind and type and may be used in operational support or supervisory capacities at an incident or at an Emergency Operations Center. (NIMS)</p>
				<p><strong>Response:</strong> The capabilities necessary to save lives, protect property and the environment, and meet basic human needs after an incident has occurred. (NPG)</p>
				<p><strong>Risk:</strong> The potential for an unwanted outcome resulting from an incident, event, or occurrence, as determined by its likelihood and the associated consequences. (NIPP, DHS Risk Lexicon)</p>
				<p><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> A product or process which collects information and assigns values to risks for the purpose of informing priorities, developing or comparing courses of action, and informing decision making. (DHS Risk Lexicon)</p>
				<p><strong>Security:</strong> The protection of the Nation and its people, vital interests, and way of life. (NPG, PPD-8)</p>
				<p><strong>Threat:</strong> A natural or manmade occurrence, individual, entity, or action that has or indicates the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property. (NIPP, DHS Risk Lexicon)</p>
				<p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> A physical feature or operational attribute that renders an entity open to exploitation or susceptible to a given hazard. (NIPP, DHS Risk Lexicon)</p>
				<p><strong>Whole Community:</strong> A focus on enabling the participation in national preparedness activities of a wider range of players from the private and nonprofit sectors, including nongovernmental organizations and the general public, in conjunction with the participation of Federal, state, and local governmental partners in order to foster better coordination and working relationships.
