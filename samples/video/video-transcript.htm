                <h3>We Prepare Everyday: Video Transcript</h3>
                <p>No two days are alike.  So, every day, you PREPARE for yourself, for those you love, for whatever the day may bring.  Being prepared is a part of who you are. But in the case of a disaster, preparation isn’t always front of mind In an emergency, when help and resources may not be available for days, being prepared is more important than ever. It’s up to everyone to BE INFORMED about what types of emergencies might occur where you live or visit Knowing the best responses for your personal circumstances is the key to maintaining your health, safety and independence. MAKE A PLAN that covers where you’ll go in an emergency and how a personal support network can assist you. BUILD A KIT that contains the specific things YOU need to survive for several days: food and water, medication and supplies, As well as any important documents you may need. Being prepared is a part of who you are, and disaster preparation is no different. There’s no one more capable of planning for your situation, than you. Be Informed. Make a Plan. Build a Kit. Get Involved. Ready.gov/myplan</p>
