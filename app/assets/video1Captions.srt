2
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:04,822
Too many communities have been touched by armed violence.

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:10,000
Sandy Hook, Columbine, Virginia Tech, New Life Church

4
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:15,500
Each time such an event happens in another community, it touches us as a nation.

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:18,799
And we are reminded that it could happen in our own community.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,721
Mass casualty incidents may occur wherever people congregate.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
In elementary and secondary schools

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,786
On college campuses

9
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:29,135
In houses of worship

10
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:31,101
Or in other venues

11
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:35,290
They are part of a complex problem that affects the entire community.

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:39,500
and that will require the whole community working together to address

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
While no measures can ensure absolute security

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,660
There are ways that we can significantly reduce the risk.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,500
Many planned attacks have been averted and countless lives have been saved

16
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:52,841
By being prepared

17
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:56,872
By sharing our collective insights, expertise, and effort

18
00:00:56,873 --> 00:01:00,000
We can minimize the likelyhood that such events will take place

19
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:03,158
And be prepared to act if an incident does occur

20
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:05,258
Are you prepared?

21
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:10,644
This course will help you understand the threats and challenges of mass casualty incidents.

22
00:01:10,744 --> 00:01:16,579
and present ways you can improve your level of preparedness should the unthinkable occur.
