                <h4>Lesson 1: Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Independent Study Course Template (Version 3.0).  This template course will serve two purposes:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>A reference with guidelines, how-tos, and materials</li>
                    <li>An example/template of the proper way to create an Independent Study (IS) course for the Emergency Management Institute (EMI).</li>

                <hr />
                <h4>Basic Structure</h4>
                <p>Most courses for FEMA are set up in the same structure. There is a splash screen that leads the student to a course menu.  From there, they select a lesson and move through all of that lesson's screens. While all of this looks transparent to the student, it is set up in a hierarchy of files.  Before you create a course, it is best to understand how everything will fit together.</p>
                <p>If you took the files from the main directory and turned them into a hierarchical bulleted list, a small two-lesson course might look something like this: </p>
                <div class="left">
                    <h4>Main Files</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ismanifest.xml</li>

                        <li>indexMenu.htm</li>
                        <li>SMPLIndex.htm</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="left">

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="clearfix"></div>
                <p>The next couple of screens will explain the usage of each of these files.</p>
                <h5>Renaming Files</h5>
                <p>The files in this sample course all begin with the prefix "SMPL."  As you develop your own course, you should change this prefix to something more meaningful to that specific course.  For example, if your course is a NIMS course you may have files named "NIMS0101080.htm."  Please note, as you use our sample template, you may need to change links from inside the template files as well so that they reference files with the new prefixes.</p>
                <hr />
                <h4>Main Files (Usage)</h4>
                <p>The following files must be included in every course. Click on each for more information about it's usage:</p>
                <p><strong>ismanifest.xml</strong></p><p>The ismanifest.xml file holds the structure and file hierarchy.  It contains references to all page-content files.  The references to each of these resources are required.  This file is called upon by the "SMPLIndex.htm" file and the information within helps build the actual course.  It is important that this file is formatted correctly.  Open up the "ismanifext.xml" file and add your lessons and all resrouces in the format that is used within this template.</p>
                <p><strong>index.htm</strong></p><p>The first file that users will see is the splash screen. This file should always be named index.htm.  It contains a collage of images related to the current course along with the course code and title.  Follow the format found in this example template.</p>
                <p><strong>indexMenu.htm</strong></p><p>The Course Menu file should be named indexMenu.htm.  This is the screen where the student gets a list of all of the lesson titles and links to the lessons.  In a single-lesson course, the index.htm page directly launches the lesson.  If you have properly developed/modified the ismanifest.xml file, you should not have to make any changes to the indexMenu.htm file.  This file automatically pulls the lessons (codes, titles, and links) from the ismanifest.xml file. </p>
                <p><strong>SMPLIndex.htm</strong></p><p>The final "main structure" file is the SMPLIndex.htm file.  This acts as the main page for all content.  It is used as a holder/frame for each individual page.  These individual pages are loaded within.  This can/should be renamed to something appropriate and related to the current course.  Again, the contents of this file should not need to be modified if the ismanifest.xml file was developed correctly.  It will automatically pull the individual page files from the &lt;resources&gt;&lt;resource&gt; section for each lesson.</p>
                <hr />
                <h4>Installing and Using the Template Files</h4>
                <img src="assets/directoryStructure.png" alt="Directory Structure Showing: Template_V3.0 at  the Top Level with the following direct descendants: assets, css, images, scripts, source, Templates" class="right" />
                <p>To begin developing a new course, we recommend creating a new folder for the course and then copying all the sample files there, and then do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rename all the files (change SMPL01 to the new prefix (i.e. NIMS01)).</li>
                    <li>Create the new site in Dreamweaver or your HTML editor of choice.</li>
                    <li>Perform a Search and Replace to search the source code and change all instances of SMPL01 to the new prefix (i.e. NIMS01).</li>
                    <li>Empty out the /assets folder.</li>
                    <li>Delete all the non-boilerplate files from the root (SMPL0101070.htm and subsequent). </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Be sure to leave all the *.xsd and *.xml files. These are the SCORM files.</strong></p>
                <hr />
                <h4>File Naming Conventions</h4>
                <p>The standard page filename is formatted like the following:  SMPL0101010.htm</p>
                <p>This filename breaks down in the following way (see bold and parenthesis)::</p>
                <p>
                    (<strong>SMPL</strong>)0101010.htm = This can be a two- to four-character string abbreviation of the course title. <br />
                    SMPL(<strong>01</strong>)01010.htm = This is a two-digit number corresponding to the course module.<br />
                    SMPL01(<strong>01</strong>)010.htm = This is a two-digit number corresponding to the lesson number. <br />
                    SMPL0101(<strong>010</strong>).htm = This is a three-digit number corresponding to the page number.  Use 010 for page 1, 020 for page 2, 100 for page 10, and so on. This gives you room to grow later; that way if you need to add a page in the middle of a lesson after the lesson has been programmed, you can create a filename with a number between the two existing screens.
                </p>
                    <hr />
                    <h4>Editing the ismanifest.xml File</h4>
                <p>The ismanifext.xml file must be properly structured and include specific references for the course to function properly.  This is required for to create a SCORM compliant course.  Follow the example found within this course and use the following information to update your ismanifest.xml file.</p>
                <p>This XML file is broken down into various required nodes.  Place the appropriate information at each node path shown below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Title</strong>:  Manifest -> Metadata -> imsmd:lom -> imsmd:general -> imsmd:title ->imsmd:langstring</li>
                    <li><strong>Description</strong>:  Manifest -> Metadata -> imsmd:lom -> imsmd:general -> imsmd:description ->imsmd:langstring</li>
                    <li><strong>Keywords (multiple allowed)</strong>:  Manifest -> Metadata -> imsmd:lom -> imsmd:general -> imsmd:keywords ->imsmd:langstring</li>
                    <li><strong>Course Title (again)</strong>: Manifest -> Organizations -> Organization -> Title</li>
                    <li><strong>Lessons (multiple allowed)</strong>: Manifest -> Organizations -> Organization -> Item</li>
                    <li><strong>Lesson Pages (multiple allowed)</strong>: Manifest -> Resources -> Resource -> File</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: For each lesson you will have a resource and multiple files underneath of that resource.  Each individual file represents a page/slide within that lesson.</p>
                <hr />
                <h4>Page Templates</h4>
                <p>The source materials for this course contains a variety of templates that should be used when developing EMI courses.  The templates can be found under the "templates" directory and are Dreamweaver files with the ".dwt" extension.</p>
                <p>We provide different templates for different types of slides/page content. For example, if you would like to have a slide with video content, you would use our video template.

                <h4>Using the Templates</h4>
                <p>You may use Dreamweaver to create files from templates; however, this is not required.  Simply follow the steps below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the appropriate template (.dwt) in the html editor of your choice.</li>
                    <li>Look for all editable areas - Editable areas are marked by the following HTML comment tags"<&#33;-- templatebegineditable name="PageHeader" -->" and <&#33;-- templateendeditable -->" where "PageHeader" may differ.</li>
                    <li>Remove content in all editable areas and replace with new content that should be displayed.</li>
                    <li>Save as (.htm) file with appropriate name.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>508 Compliance Guidelines</h4>
                <p>All electronic course content must meet EMI's 508 guidelines.  The information below is a quick guide that contains common issues and suggestions to ensure that your content is compliant.  EMI's full testing process can be found here: <a href="http://training.fema.gov/devres/508.aspx">508 - Developer Resources Page</a>.  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alt Tags - Alternative text is required and must accurately describe the image.  If text is found within the image, that full text must be included in the alt text.</li>
                    <li>
                        Tables
                        <ul>
                            <li>Properly identify all headers</li>
                            <li>Do not use images of tables</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Videos - Closed Captioning and Audio Descriptions</li>
                    <li>Forms - Properly associate labels to form elements</li>
                    <li>Do not modify the template - The template was built and tested for 508 compliance.  Only modify "content" areas to ensure that it remains compliant.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr />
                <h4>Best Practices and Standards</h4>
                <p>When building content, follow the guidelines below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid using tables for layout purposes.  Tables should be used for data purposes only unless necessary.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using inline styles. Use <i>CSS classes</i> supplied to style content instead.</li>
                    <li>Responsive content - Allow your content to change size based upon the browser size.  Try not to enforce image height and width.</li>
                    <li>Do not use Adobe Flash</li>
                    <li>Browser support - Your content should display properly in the following web browsers: Internet Explorer 9 and above, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari</li>
                    <li>Test functionality in all supported browsers.</li>
                </ul>
