			<h3>Knowledge Review (True/False)</h3>
			<p>This page contains an example of a "True/False" Knowledge Check.  Follow the example found on this page.  The "FeedbackMC.js" must be referenced for this to work properly.  In addition, the following JavaScript variables should be modified: Feedback, FeedbackWrong, and vCorrectAnswer.  </p>
			<p>The EMI Snippet titled "MultiChoice" can be used as a basic template for the True/False question or any multiple choice, single answer question.</p>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <form name="form1" action="">

                    <strong>Instructions: Review the case study and select your answer. &nbsp;</strong><br /><br />
                        <img src="assets/IS987_0227.gif" alt="Tribal symbol for Lummi Nation " class="left" /><strong> Case Study: </strong> The Lummi Nation has a clinic that effectively serves the tribal communities for day-to-day and routine health care issues. Although the clinic is responsible for public health in the community, it lacks the resources to respond to a public health emergency. For example, the tribe does not have a mechanism in place for quarantine and isolation. <br /><br />
                    <strong>True or False: the Lummi Nation's clinic is  prepared for public health emergencies.</strong>
