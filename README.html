                build new lessons and steps from a dynamic interface. This page will walk
                you through the process of setting up your development environment, creating
                your own pages, and deploying into production.

                The file structure of this application varies slightly from the one
                <a href="http://training.fema.gov/devres/docs/IS_Template_V3_0.zip">provided</a> by FEMA.
                FEMAs samples are incompatible with modern versions of Adobe Dreamweaver, and are not named
                so finding the one you want can be a complicated task.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further ease development, a <em>Page Builder</em> is included with this template
                which allows a user to select the lesson page they want to build, and can interactively
                generate the necessary steps to integrate their page. If users would rather just copy and paste
                the sample HTML however, they are certainly welcome to do that.

                This template supports many different development environments, from

                        Through the use of gulp, you are able to use the editor of your
                        choice when creating your own lessons. To do use, users must
                        install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> on their machine, and
                        afterwards running <span class="label label-primary">npm install</span> in

                        a few minutes for everything to download.

                The Page Builder will walk you through the process of creating a new
                lesson and adding steps to it, but here is a short summary of what is
                required to build a new lesson from scratch:
            </p>
            <p class="lead">imsmanifest.xml</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-8">

                    </a>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>
                        The <span class="label label-primary">imsmanifest.xml</span> file contains the
                        required lesson information which preserves the order and description of
                        each lesson. To add a new lesson or lesson step, this file <strong>must</strong>
                        be edited each time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are using the page builder, the required XML markup will be provided
                        to you based on your provided input.

                    <p>
                        The Page Builder aims to be as set-and-forget as possible, but if you
                        have installed this on a non-root URL, you will have to configure the
                        <span class="label label-primary">applicationRoot</span> variable
                        on both the <span class="label label-primary">app/page-builder/index.html</span>
                        and <span class="label label-primary">app/page-builder/new-step.html</span>
                        files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you have installed your instance on <strong>http://www.myurl.com/fema</strong>,
                        then set your applicationRoot variable to <span class="label label-primary">/fema</span>.
                        It is important to set this so that the Page Builder correctly loads the configurator fields.

                Pushing your customized lesson pages to your production server is a simple process.
                Just follow the steps below and you should be set.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Connect to your production server (either via FTP, SSH or web interface)</li>
                <li>While optional, it is recommended to back up your existing lesson instance before continuing.</li>
                <li>Copy and paste the <em>entire</em> contents of the app/ folder</li>
                <li>Overwrite any files that need to be overwritten.</li>
                <li>Once done uploading, test to make sure everything was uploaded correctly</li>
                <li>If it looks good, you are all done.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This can often times be accomplished directly through Dreamweaver if you have your
                production server details all filled in. Otherwise, using a program such as FileZilla
                for FTP uploads or PuTTY for SSH uploads is recommended.
